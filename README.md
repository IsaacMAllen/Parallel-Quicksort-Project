## Hours Log
6/15/22 2 to 4pm - Picking a topic & starting research.







Edit this README file so that it contains the following:

-an indication of how much time you spent on the project (you should keep track of this as you go)
-a description of what the project does
-an explanation of how to compile and run the program (and what machine to run it on).  
 If your instructor doesn't have access to the machine then you should put screenshots of runs of 
 your code in the respository.
-a list of what was completed
-a list of what didn't get completed because of bugs in the code
-a list of what didn't get completed due to lack of time (ideas for future work)
-a link to the presentation that you gave to the class (or put the actual presentation in the repository)
